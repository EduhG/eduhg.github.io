Chrome DevTools Overview

The Chrome Developer Tools (DevTools for short), are a set of web authoring and debugging tools built into Google Chrome. The DevTools provide web developers deep access into the internals of the browser and their web application. Use the DevTools to efficiently track down layout issues, set JavaScript breakpoints, and get insights for code optimization.

### Accessing the DevTools

To access the DevTools, open a web page or web app in Google Chrome. Either:

Select the Chrome menu Chrome Menu at the top-right of your browser window, then select Tools > Developer Tools.
Right-click on any page element and select Inspect Element.
The DevTools window will open at the bottom of your Chrome browser.
