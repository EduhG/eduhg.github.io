CAUTION

You should NOT write to the failed device, as it can worsen a hardware failure, and overwrite existant data in case of lost files .

Shut down the affected machine as soon as possible, and restart it from a LiveCD or LiveUSB. Be certain that the "live" cd does not automatically mount any partition or swap space.
