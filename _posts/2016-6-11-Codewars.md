Codewars is a collective effort by its users. They are creators - authoring kata to teach various techniques, solving kata with solutions that enlighten others, and commenting with constructive feedback.

The most interesting thing about Codewars? **Achieve mastery through challenge** by Improve your skills by training with others on real code challenges

You sharpen your skills by challenge yourself on kata, created by the community to strengthen different skills. Master your current language of choice, or expand your understanding of a new one.

Coding problems are provided as katas that you solve with your coding style right in the browser and use test cases (TDD) to check it as you progress. Retrain with new, creative, and optimized approaches. Every Kata solved adds you honors that are used in ranking.

The challenges and katas range from Mathematical problems to Logical Reasoning. Solution provided should run in less than 11000 seconds, otherwise, you get an error as much as your solution based on the test cases is correct.

So far the most challenging Katas are of Java Programming.
