title: Hello Codewars!
---

Codewars is a collective effort by its users. They are creators - authoring kata to teach various techniques, solving kata with solutions that enlighten others, and commenting with constructive feedback.

Codewars covers a wide range of programming languages; from Java, JavaScript, Python to CoffeeScript. Some kata challenges cover most of the languages and as a user you can solve the challenges using a language of your choice.

The most interesting thing about Codewars? **Achieve mastery through challenge** by Improve your skills by training with others on real code challenges

**Kata**

Each programming task is called a Kata. They include a short task description, a set of input data, and the desired output data. The student is tasked with writing a function in his preferred programming language to transform the given input into the desired output. This is all done with the online, built-in programming editor.

You sharpen your skills by challenge yourself on kata, created by the community to strengthen different skills. Master your current language of choice, or expand your understanding of a new one.

Coding problems are provided as katas that you solve with your coding style right in the browser and use test cases (TDD) to check it as you progress. Retrain with new, creative, and optimized approaches. Every Kata solved adds you honors that are used in ranking.
The student is also tasked with writing his own tests, and the outcome of the tests (pass or fail) give clues as to whether the code is ready to submit to the public. To make the Katas more difficult, the given set of input-output data in the task description is only a subset of the data used to test a Kata before submitting it to the public. The user can run his function against his own test with a button or can press "submit" to test it against the bigger, hidden dataset. Only once all tests are passed can the function be uploaded to and inspected by the public.
The challenges and katas range from Mathematical problems to Logical Reasoning. Solution provided should run in less than 11000 seconds, otherwise, you get an error as much as your solution based on the test cases is correct.

To join Codewars, you must prove your worth by completing 2 basic challenges. Thereafter, select the Katas you want to solve based on your skill level and preferred programming language
