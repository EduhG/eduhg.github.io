Want to use Git and GitHub?

Git is a version control system that is widely used for software development and other version control tasks. It is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. It is a free and open source designed to handle everything from small to very large. It is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.
To use GIT you must first turn your directory into a repository by navigating to the directory using your terminal and using GIT command - **git init**.
The command initializes your directory for use as a repository. Once a GIT repository various GIT commands can be run for Version control.
Using GIT is a great practice as it helps you track your work. Changes made to a project can be tracked. GIT enables you to get old versions of your project that otherwise on normal basis you canâ€™t as once you save your work it overwrites the present.
GIT is used for remote version control. To put your project online and track your changes, comes **GitHub** which is an online repository serve, where all your GIT repositories can be accessed from.
For GIT and GitHub to work together you must initialize your local GIT with your remote (GitHub) account details providing your GitHub username and email.
This enables you to push your local repository changes, to your remote repository on GitHub. Sometimes, however, GIT and GitHub may fail to synchronize especially when pushing changes to GitHub due to RSA key miss match. This is easily resolved by following the steps in GitHub to generate and deploy your new RSA key to GitHub, only then will you be able to push your changes.
Using GitHub is a good practice as you can never lose you projects once hosted to GitHub as all you need to do is navigate to your terminal and clone your remote repository to your machine.
