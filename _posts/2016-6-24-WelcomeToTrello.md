Want to use Trello like a pro?

Trello is an awesome project management tool that makes collaboration easy and, dare I say, even fun. But this visual list tool can do so much more, whether you're organizing work projects, family chores, travel plans, or just about anything else. Here are some ways to put Trello to use for managing your entire life.

A Trello board is basically a web page containing lists laid out horizontally on the page so you can get a bird's eye view of your project. Items within the lists, called cards, can be dragged and dropped onto other lists or reordered within lists.

Individual cards themselves can contain checklists, images, attachments, deadline dates, colored labels, and discussion notes from others who share the board. You can have as many boards as you want—one for "House Stuff," for example, one for "World Domination," and so on.

You can probably see how this comes in handy. Trello cards are like sticky notes you arrange on a cork board—that is, digital sticky notes that are searchable, shareable, and come with reminders. You can also create cards via email.

Trello works for me because I tend to think very visually, and images and colored labels register with my brain better than plain text. While I'm a big fan of Evernote for managing tons of information, in the past I found myself turning back to individual lists scrawled on paper and even index cards spread out everywhere to get that top-level overview of my days. Trello was a big upgrade; it's one of those few apps that actually balances both a simple, elegant user interface and powerful, flexible features.
